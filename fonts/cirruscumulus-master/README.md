# *CirrusCumulus*
*CirrusCumulus* was designed without curve, made up of different modules inspired by scientific diagrams. *CirrusCumulus* is also a hybridization of two styles : it’s both a lineal by its lowercases, as well as a script by its uppercases, while some adopt italic and create unusual pairs by using arabesques and ligatures. *CirrusCumulus* includes a large panel of glyphs to draw figures, shapes or patterns, a variable ligature system, non-binary and many inclusive glyphs. <br>
